* TODO meal planning
It would be really useful to plan meals, in addition to being able to record what was ingested.
* TODO calendar view
Should be able to view diary/journal as a calendar or timeline, varying from month view, to week view, and finally to day view.
* TODO nutrition goals
For each day, keep track of the user's desired calories, macronutrients, food guide servings, water intake, etc.
